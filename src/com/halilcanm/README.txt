Required: What’s the easiest way for me to compile and test your code?
• Required: A description of what you could accomplish and what you learned.
• Required: The numerical results you got for all the parts you completed
• What was the hardest part?
• What are some of the pros and cons of each log format? Why?
• How fast are your parser(s)? What could you do to improve performance? What’s the
time complexity of your algorithm?
• Can you create a graph of some of the data? Feel free to use excel etc. You can graph
whatever you want, but I suggest looking at the front and rear wheel speeds from our
acceleration run. Do you notice anything interesting?
• Why might front and rear wheel speeds produce different results?
• The data timestamps are created by the logging program. Is there anything wrong with
doing this? Do you notice any difference between the timestamps on the csv format and
the first format?
• Each piece of data has to be sent out separately, meaning that you could get two different
pieces of information you need at different times. How did you deal with this? Is there a
better way?
